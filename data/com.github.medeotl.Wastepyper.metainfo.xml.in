    <p>
      Feeling guilty of signing up to task list services, populating endless
      task lists, then never returning to them? Tired of spending too much time
      trying to find the perfect productivity system, the best personal
      organization tool, the one trick to make you more productive?
    </p>
    <p>
      If yes, then Wastepaper is for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wastepaper is an ephemeral task list app. Tasks and lists are never stored
      anywhere. Once you close a window, all is gone. It lets you focus on what
      really matters. Offload the most immediate tasks from your mind, and just
      as quickly, complete them. Rinse and repeat until all important tasks are
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, each completed task deserves a celebration!
    </p>
